
Suppose we have Orders and Customers tables. 
Orders includes Order_ID, Customer_ID, and Order_Amount, while Customers
 includes Customer_ID, Customer_Name, and City. Write a SQL query to find the 
cities which have customers who have placed more than 10 orders with a total 
Order_Amount of more than $10,000.

Given an 'Employees' table with columns: 
Emp_id, Name, Salary, and Dept, please 
write a SQL query to find and list the departments that have more than 100 employees

Select * table
From Employees Emp_id NameSalary_Dept
where departments >=100 employees
