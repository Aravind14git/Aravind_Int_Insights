Pointers are not used:
They are unsafe
Increases the complexity of program
JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation then pointer not required

whata is JIT compiler in java:
JIT compiler converts bytes code into machine codes with the help of interpreter

javasource code--> jdk envi(javac .exe)--> bytecode-->Interpreter+JIT compiler(JRE enviro)
--> machine language

Marker interface?
An empty interface called MI,have no data member and member function
eg serializable, cloneable

can you override a private or static method in java?
you cannot override private & static method in java
Private methods cannot override since its not access in subclasses
static method cannot override in child class

finally always execute in java?
no, system crashes, sytem.exit () function - finally dont execute

what method does the object class have?
java.lang.Object - parent class of all the methoeds

how can you make a class Immutable?
declare the class as final so it cant b extended
make all the fields private so direct access is not allowed
Make mutable fields final so the value can be assigned once

Singleton class in java& how can we make?
It is a class one instanfe can be created at any give time, in one JVM

Java does not support multiple inheritance and for that only we have interface

Serialization:
Serialization it is a mechanis of writinng code, converts byte code to object code
Deserialization is the opposite of serialization

Final, finally both are keywords.Finalize is a method
fnal used to define constants
finally is used in exceptions
finalize used in garbage collection, before garbage collection finalize

Springboot(It is a framework) is a communication b/n client and server, client request to server
and server respond to the client

Collection framework is used to store the data
It has class Array List, Hast Set and Maps
-----
String:
String is a java class defined in java.lang.package
string class implements - comparable, charSequence, serializable interfaces
-----------
String objection creatin
using string literal
String constant pool is special memory in the heap area, it is allocated to
store string objects created using literal
String s="will";
usign string new  keyword
String s = new String("will");
---------------
Strings are thread safe in java. Since cant modify these are thread safe.
Even multiple thread try to access no error will observe
-------
String ==,equals()
== operators compares the same memory location
equals() method for content comparison

equals() method only we should prefer in testing/coding
------------
String intern()
Method intern() creates an exact copy of the string object in the heap memory
and store it in string constant pool
String s1="abc";
String s2= new String("abc");
String s3= s2.intern();
Sysout(s1==s3);
o/p= true
------------------------------------------
string to char array

string str = "Test";
char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
Sysout(chars.length);
char c =str.charAt(2);
Sysout(c);
}
---------------
String to bytes

String str ="suresh";
byte[] bytes=str.getBytes();
Sysout(Arrays.toString(bytes));
o/p: [ 83, 117,...]
-----------------
Bytes to string

byte[] byte1= { 83, 117, 33, 54};
String str = new String(byte1);
Sysout(str);

o/p: suresh
-------------------
super class of all class
--> java.lang.Object class is the super class of all class
--------------

String s1= "abc";/ this will go to string pool
String s2= new String("abc");// this will be heap memory
s2.intern();
sysout(s1==s2);

O/p; false
->intern() method will return string object reference from string
pool, so if we assign s2= s2.intern();  then will be O/P true

------
String s1= new String("abc");
String s2= new String("abc");
sysout(s1==s2);

O/P: false
Both are having different heap memroy location
----
Yes we can overload main method
but look for public static void main(String[] args)
---------------
Final Keyword

Final keyword is used in class to make sure no other class can extend it
Final  keyword with methods to make sure child class cant override it
Final keyword can be used in variable to make sure to assign only once
----------------
Byte code(can execute in any platform) and JVM hence its platform independent

count sum o
f digits, count of digits, even and odd,sum of eleme

Web service is used for REST, SOAP, and XML-RPC for communication, while API is used for any style of communication. 
Web service supports only HTTP protocol, whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
 Web service supports XML, while API supports XML and JSON
