
The difference between Selenium IDE vs WebDriver is that 
Selenium IDE is a browser plug-in designed for recording and playing back 
tests. Selenium WebDriver is a code library of APIs for controlling browsers

Selenium IDE does not assist object oriented programming.
 The elements can be identified only with absolute xpath in Selenium IDE.
 In case of a dynamic webpage, we may have to handle multiple navigations, 
alerts, pop-ups and so on. All these cannot be handled with Selenium IDE

In Selenium 3, testers often faced challenges with browser-specific 
implementations, which could lead to inconsistent test results. 
Selenium 4 addresses this issue by providing a more unified and predictable
 testing experience across various browsers, thereby making cross-browser 
testing more efficient and reliable

latest version -4.21.0

Selenium Grid is designed to facilitate parallel and distributed 
testing across multiple machines and browsers simultaneously.
